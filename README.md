# DigiCube

A Digimon mod for Minecraft Java Edition. Find, tame, raise, train and digivolve
partner Digimon.

- **Minecraft** 26.2 · **Fabric** loader · **Java** 25
- NeoForge support is planned; the project is already structured for it.

> Unofficial fan project. Digimon is a trademark of Bandai. Do not ship assets you
> did not make.

## 1. First-time setup

You need three things. Nothing else.

### a) A JDK (Java Development Kit) 25

Java is the language Minecraft is written in. The JDK is the compiler plus the runtime.

```bash
winget install EclipseAdoptium.Temurin.25.JDK
```

Close and reopen your terminal afterwards, then check it worked:

```bash
java -version
```

You should see version `25`. If the command is not found, the terminal did not pick up
the new PATH — reopen it, or reboot.

### b) An IDE — IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition

Free, and by far the best editor for Minecraft mods. It decompiles Minecraft for you, so
you can ctrl-click any vanilla method and read its real source. That is your single most
useful debugging tool.

```bash
winget install JetBrains.IntelliJIDEA.Community
```

Open IntelliJ, choose **Open**, and select this `digicube` folder. It will detect Gradle
and start importing. **The first import takes 10–30 minutes** — it downloads Minecraft and
decompiles it. This happens once.

### c) Git

Already installed on this machine.

## 2. The tools, and what each one does

| Tool | What it is | Why you care |
|---|---|---|
| **Gradle** | The build system. Driven by `gradlew` / `gradlew.bat`. | One command compiles the mod, downloads Minecraft, and launches a test game. You never install it — the wrapper script fetches the right version. |
| **Fabric Loom** | A Gradle plugin for Fabric mods. | Sets up a runnable, deobfuscated Minecraft to develop against. |
| **ModDevGradle** | A Gradle plugin from NeoForge. | Gives the `common/` module a plain Minecraft to compile against, with no loader attached. |
| **Fabric Loader** | The thing that actually loads mods at runtime. | Players install this. |
| **Fabric API** | A shared library of hooks Fabric itself does not provide. | Nearly every Fabric mod depends on it, including this one. |
| **Mixin** | A library for patching vanilla classes at load time. | The escape hatch when no API exists. Use sparingly. |
| **Blockbench** | A free 3D model editor built for Minecraft. | Where Digimon models and animations will be made. |

### Why Minecraft has to be "decompiled"

Minecraft ships as compiled, obfuscated code — classes named `a`, `b`, `c`. To write a mod
you need readable names. The build tools download Minecraft, apply Mojang's official name
mappings, and decompile it into readable Java. That's the slow first build. Afterwards it
is cached.

Because we use **Mojang's official mappings**, the class names you see are `Identifier`,
`Level`, `Player`. Note that 26.x renamed `ResourceLocation` to `Identifier`, and Yarn names
(`World`, `PlayerEntity`) do not exist here at all — neither will compile.

## 3. The development loop

This is the cycle you will repeat all day.

```
edit code  ->  ./gradlew :fabric:runClient  ->  test in game  ->  read the log  ->  repeat
```

**Build the mod** (compile and package, no game):

```bash
./gradlew build
```

**Launch Minecraft with the mod already loaded:**

```bash
./gradlew :fabric:runClient
```

This opens a real Minecraft client. Create a world and test. You do **not** need to install
anything into your normal Minecraft — this is a separate, throwaway instance living in
`fabric/runs/client/`.

**Launch a dedicated server** (always test this too — server-side crashes are the most
common bug in mods):

```bash
./gradlew :fabric:runServer
```

In IntelliJ, the same two runs appear as **DigiCube Client (Fabric)** and
**DigiCube Server (Fabric)** in the run dropdown at the top right. Use those instead of the
terminal — you get breakpoints and a debugger.

### Testing what you built

Once in game:

```
/give @s digicube:digivice
```

If you get a black-and-purple cube called `item.digicube.digivice`, a texture, model or
lang file is missing — see the item checklist in `AGENTS.md` section 6.

### When something breaks

1. Read `fabric/runs/client/logs/latest.log`. The real error is in the stack trace, usually
   near the phrase `Caused by:`.
2. A crash on startup is almost always a missing resource file or a bad mixin.
3. A missing texture or a wrong name is a resource-path problem, not a code problem.

You can leave the game running and use **Ctrl+F9** in IntelliJ to hot-swap changed method
bodies. Adding new classes, fields or registry entries still needs a restart.

## 4. How the project is organised

```
common/   the mod itself: domain model, items, registration, assets. No loader code.
fabric/   a thin adapter that boots common/ on Fabric.
buildSrc/ shared build logic.
```

Nearly everything you write goes in `common/`. The `fabric/` module only holds the entry
point and the few things Fabric does differently. That split is what makes adding NeoForge
later a new folder rather than a rewrite.

Full conventions, naming rules and architectural constraints are in
**[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** — that file is also the instruction set for AI coding agents
working in this repo.

## 5. Shipping a build

```bash
./gradlew build
```

The player-facing jar is `fabric/build/libs/digicube-fabric-26.2.jar`. Ignore the
`-sources` and `-javadoc` jars.

To try it in your real Minecraft: install Fabric Loader for 26.2, drop that jar plus
[Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) into your `mods/` folder.

## 6. Current state

Working:

- Build system for Minecraft 26.2 on Fabric, structured for NeoForge later
- Platform abstraction via `ServiceLoader`
- One item, `digicube:digivice`, registered end to end with model, texture and translation
- Digimon domain model: species, stages, attributes with a damage triangle, evolution branches
- Three placeholder species (Koromon, Agumon, Greymon) as a fixture
- A working mixin, as proof the pipeline runs
- CI that builds on every push

Not built yet, roughly in the order it should be tackled:

1. **Data-driven species loading** from `data/digicube/species/*.json`, replacing the
   hardcoded bootstrap. Do this before adding Digimon in bulk.
2. **The Digimon entity** — a tameable mob holding level, bond, training and current species.
3. **Rendering** with [GeckoLib](https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib) (supports 26.2) and
   models made in Blockbench.
4. **The evolution engine** — evaluating `Evolution` branches and swapping species at runtime.
5. **The Digivice UI** — a screen showing your partner's stats.
6. **Spawning, taming, and DigiEggs.**
